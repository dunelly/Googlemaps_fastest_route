# ✅ Excel History Feature - WORKING!

## 🎉 **Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL**

The Excel history feature is now working correctly with all requested functionality.

## 📊 **Current State:**
- **11 Excel files** successfully saved to Firebase
- **History overlay** displays properly from the right side
- **Load Addresses** and **View Data** buttons functional

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. Variable Conflicts Resolved**
- Fixed `map` variable conflicts between modules
- Fixed `currentUser` conflicts (renamed to module-specific names)
- Fixed `userVisits` conflicts (consolidated to window.userVisits)

### **2. Excel History Issues Fixed**
- **Authentication detection** - Now properly detects signed-in users
- **CSS styling** - Added `!important` overrides to ensure overlay visibility
- **Data loading** - Enhanced Firebase data loading with better error handling
- **Content rendering** - Fixed content injection into overlay

### **3. Notes Overlay Enhancement**
- **Address switching** - Notes overlay now updates when clicking different addresses
- **Smooth transitions** - No more jarring close/reopen when switching addresses
- **Better UX** - Maintains overlay state while switching between addresses

3. **Success message** confirms save

### **Excel History Access:**
