# Notes Icon Removal - Cleaner UI Design

## UI Improvement Applied
Removed redundant notes icons (üìù) from the destination addresses box to create a cleaner, more streamlined interface.

## Problem Identified
- **Redundant functionality**: Notes icons were displayed next to each address in the list
- **Visual clutter**: Extra buttons created unnecessary UI complexity
- **Duplicate interaction**: Clicking the address already opens the notes overlay

## Solution Applied
**Removed notes icons while preserving all functionality** - clicking on the address text still opens both the map highlight and notes overlay.

## Changes Made

### File: `js/address-list-renderer.js`

**1. Removed note button creation from list items:**
```javascript
// REMOVED:
// Note icon button
const noteBtn = createNoteButton(item.address);
li.appendChild(noteBtn);
```

**2. Cleaned up unused functions:**
- Removed `createNoteButton()` function
- Removed `updateNoteButtonStyle()` function

## Result - Cleaner Interface
