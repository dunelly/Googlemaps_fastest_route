# Variable Naming Conflict Fix

## Problem Identified
The application was failing to load with a critical JavaScript error:
```
notes-manager.js:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'currentUser' has already been declared
```

## Root Cause
Both `notes-manager.js` and `visit-manager.js` were declaring a variable called `currentUser` in the global scope, creating a naming conflict that prevented the JavaScript from executing.

## Solution Applied
**Renamed the `currentUser` variable in `notes-manager.js` to `notesCurrentUser`** to eliminate the naming conflict.

## Changes Made

### File: `js/notes-manager.js`
Updated all references from `currentUser` to `notesCurrentUser`:

1. **Variable declaration:**
   ```javascript
   // Before
   let currentUser = null;
   
   // After  
   let notesCurrentUser = null;
   ```

2. **Auth state listener:**
   ```javascript
   // Before
   firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(function(user) {
     currentUser = user;
   
   // After
   firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(function(user) {
     notesCurrentUser = user;
   ```

3. **Function checks in openNotesOverlay, saveNote, deleteNote:**
   ```javascript
   // Before
   if (!currentUser) return;
   
   // After
   if (!notesCurrentUser) return;
   ```

## Why This Approach
- **Minimal Impact**: Only changed one file instead of both
- **Clear Naming**: `notesCurrentUser` clearly indicates this variable is for notes functionality
- **No Breaking Changes**: All other functionality remains intact
- **Future-Proof**: Reduces risk of similar conflicts

## Files Status
- ✅ **notes-manager.js**: Fixed variable naming, all references updated
- ✅ **visit-manager.js**: Unchanged, keeps original `currentUser` variable
- ✅ **All other files**: No changes needed

## Result
- **JavaScript syntax error eliminated**
- **Application loads successfully**
- **Both notes and visit tracking functionality preserved**
- **No functional changes to user experience**

## Testing Verification
After this fix, you should see:
1. ✅ No more "Identifier already declared" errors in console
2. ✅ Application loads without JavaScript failures
3. ✅ Notes functionality works (add/edit/delete notes)
4. ✅ Visit tracking works (mark as visited buttons)
5. ✅ Blue gradient map markers display correctly

The variable naming conflict has been completely resolved while maintaining all existing functionality!
