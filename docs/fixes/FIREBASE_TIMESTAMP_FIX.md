# Firebase Timestamp Fix - Visit Tracking Now Fully Functional

## Problem Identified
When trying to mark an address as visited, the application was throwing a Firebase error:
```
FirebaseError: Function DocumentReference.set() called with invalid data. FieldValue.serverTimestamp() is not currently supported inside arrays
```

## Root Cause
The visit tracking system was trying to store `firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` inside the `visitHistory` array, but Firestore doesn't allow server timestamps inside arrays.

**Problematic code:**
```javascript
const newVisit = {
  date: now,
  timestamp: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp() // ‚ùå Not allowed in arrays
};
```

## Solution Applied
**Removed the `timestamp` field from visitHistory array entries** since we already have a proper ISO date string in the `date` field.

## Changes Made

### File: `js/visit-manager.js`
**Before:**
```javascript
// Add new visit
const newVisit = {
  date: now,
  timestamp: firebase.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Add new visit
const newVisit = {
  date: now
};
```

## Data Structure
The visit tracking now uses this clean structure:
```javascript
{
  address: "123 Main St, Houston, TX",
  visitCount: 2,
  lastVisited: "2025-06-05T14:05:34.221Z",
  visitHistory: [
    { date: "2025-06-05T14:04:54.221Z" },
    { date: "2025-06-05T14:05:34.221Z" }
  ]
}
```
