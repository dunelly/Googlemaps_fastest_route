# Stack Overflow Fix - Excel Data Table ✅

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Excel History "View Data" button was causing a **Maximum call stack size exceeded** error due to infinite recursion in the `renderDataTableWithFeatures` function.

## Root Cause
The recursion was happening because:
1. `renderDataTableWithFeatures()` was calling `renderDataTable()`
2. At the bottom of the file, `window.renderDataTable` was assigned to `renderDataTableWithFeatures`
3. This created an infinite loop: `renderDataTableWithFeatures` → `renderDataTable` → `renderDataTableWithFeatures` → ...

## Solution Applied
**Fixed the recursion by:**
1. **Renamed the core function**: Created `renderDataTableCore()` with the actual table rendering logic
2. **Updated function call**: `renderDataTableWithFeatures()` now calls `renderDataTableCore()` instead of `renderDataTable()`
3. **Removed duplicate code**: Eliminated the original `renderDataTable()` function that was causing confusion
4. **Maintained functionality**: All enhanced features (drag selection, auction date filter, delete) still work

## Code Changes Made

### File: `js/excel-data-table.js`

**Before (Causing Recursion):**
```javascript
function renderDataTableWithFeatures() {
  renderDataTable(); // This was calling itself due to window assignment!
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    populateAuctionDateFilter();
    initializeTableDragSelection();
  }, 100);
}

// At bottom of file:
window.renderDataTable = renderDataTableWithFeatures; // Created the recursion!
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
function renderDataTableCore() {
  // Core table rendering logic (moved here to avoid recursion)
  const dataContent = document.getElementById('excelDataContent');
  // ... rest of rendering logic
}

function renderDataTableWithFeatures() {
  renderDataTableCore(); // Now calls the core function directly
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    populateAuctionDateFilter();
    initializeTableDragSelection();
  }, 100);
}

// At bottom of file:
window.renderDataTable = renderDataTableWithFeatures; // Now safe!
```

## Testing Results
✅ **Excel History "View Data" Button**: 
- No more stack overflow errors
- Enhanced data table loads properly
- All features work: sorting, filtering, selection, drag selection
- Auction date filter populates correctly
- Delete functionality works

✅ **Map Pin Visit Tracking**: 
- Also confirmed working (previous fix maintained)
- Pins stay visible after marking visits
- Address data sources properly detected

## Enhanced Features Still Available
- ✅ Drag selection in data table
- ✅ Multi-column sorting
- ✅ Advanced filtering (status, notes, visit count, auction date)
- ✅ Address search
- ✅ Bulk delete selected addresses
- ✅ Show selected addresses on map
- ✅ Visit tracking integration
- ✅ Notes integration

## Benefits
- **Eliminated Crashes**: No more browser freezing due to infinite recursion
- **Improved Performance**: Clean function calls without stack overflow
- **Maintained Features**: All enhanced table functionality preserved
- **Better Code Structure**: Cleaner separation between core rendering and enhanced features
- **Debugging**: Easier to troubleshoot with clear function hierarchy

The Excel History "View Data" button now works reliably without any recursion issues!
