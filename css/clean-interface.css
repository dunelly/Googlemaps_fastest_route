/* 
 * This file now serves as the main entry point for the clean interface styles.
 * All styles have been organized into logical modules for better maintainability:
 * 
 * Layout:
 * - panels.css: Left/right panel styling and overrides
 * - responsive.css: Mobile and tablet responsive adjustments
 * 
 * Components:
 * - buttons.css: All button variants and states
 * - forms.css: Input fields, textareas, form sections
 * - tabs.css: Tab navigation and content areas
 * - modals.css: Modal overlays, content, and animations
 * - notes.css: Notes overlay and visit tracking
 * 
 * This modular approach provides:
 * - Better code organization and maintainability
 * - Easier collaboration between developers
 * - Reduced duplication and cleaner separation of concerns
 * - Faster debugging and feature development
