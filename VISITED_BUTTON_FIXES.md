# Visited Button Functionality Fixes

## Overview
Fixed the visited button functionality throughout the application to properly track visits, display visit status, and integrate with the address list interface.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Address List Display Issues
- **Problem**: Address list didn't show visit status or note icons
- **Solution**: Updated `updateMiddleAddresses()` function in `address-manager.js` to:
  - Display visit status with color-coded indicators
  - Show "last visited" information with appropriate colors
  - Add note icons that change style when notes exist
  - Apply background highlighting for recently visited addresses

### 2. Missing Visit Status Integration
- **Problem**: Visit data wasn't being displayed in the address list
- **Solution**: Enhanced address list generation to:
  - Call visit tracking functions to get visit data
  - Display visit status with color coding (green=today, yellow=1-3 days, etc.)
  - Show formatted visit information inline with addresses

### 3. Note Icon Integration
- **Problem**: Note icons were missing from address list
- **Solution**: Added note icon buttons to each address with:
  - Visual indicator when notes exist (blue background)
  - Click handlers to open notes overlay
  - Proper styling and hover effects

### 4. Global Data Synchronization
- **Problem**: Notes and visit data wasn't synced between modules
- **Solution**: Made data globally available and updated:
  - `window.userNotes` synced when notes are loaded/saved/deleted
  - `updateMiddleAddresses()` made globally available
  - Automatic refresh of address list when data changes

### 5. Visit Tracking Integration
- **Problem**: Visit tracking didn't update address list display
- **Solution**: Enhanced visit tracker to:
  - Refresh address list after recording visits
  - Update map markers with new visit data
  - Properly handle both single and bulk visit marking

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Mark Single Visit**: Open notes overlay for an address and click "Mark as Visited"
