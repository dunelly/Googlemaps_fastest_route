# Map Pins Display Fix - Issue Resolved

## Problem Identified
After the file size refactoring, the map pins (markers) were not displaying when uploading Excel files. This was due to improper global variable sharing between the new modular files.

## Root Cause
When we split the `map-handler.js` file into multiple modules, the global variables (`map`, `drawnItems`, `drawControl`, `addressMarkersLayer`) were being assigned to `window` at module load time, but they were still `undefined` at that point. The variables only get values when the initialization functions run, but the `window` assignments happened immediately on script load.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed map-core.js
**Issue:** Global variables assigned before initialization
**Fix:** Moved global assignments inside `initializeBasicMap()` function after variables are created
```javascript
// Before: Variables assigned to window at module load (undefined)
window.map = map; // map was undefined

// After: Variables assigned after initialization
function initializeBasicMap() {
  map = L.map('map').setView([29.7604, -95.3698], 10);
  // ... initialization code ...
  
  // Make variables globally available AFTER they're initialized
  window.map = map;
  window.drawnItems = drawnItems;
  window.drawControl = drawControl;
}
```

### 2. Fixed map-markers.js
**Issue:** `addressMarkersLayer` not properly updated in global scope
**Fix:** Added global assignment after creating the layer group
```javascript
// Before: Only local variable updated
addressMarkersLayer = L.layerGroup(markers).addTo(window.map);

// After: Both local and global variables updated
addressMarkersLayer = L.layerGroup(markers).addTo(window.map);
window.addressMarkersLayer = addressMarkersLayer; // Update global reference
```

### 3. Fixed map-drawing.js
**Issue:** Button references needed for backward compatibility
**Fix:** Added global button references in `updateActionButtons()`
```javascript
function updateActionButtons(hasSelection) {
  const copyBtn = document.getElementById('copySelectedBtn');
  const markVisitedBtn = document.getElementById('markSelectedVisitedBtn');
  
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Also update global references for backward compatibility
  window.copyBtn = copyBtn;
  window.markVisitedBtn = markVisitedBtn;
}
```

### 4. Cleaned up map-core.js
**Issue:** Duplicate global assignments
**Fix:** Removed redundant assignments at bottom of file since they're now done in initialization

## Result
✅ **Map pins now display correctly** when uploading Excel files
✅ **All map functionality restored** - drawing, markers, popups
✅ **Visit tracking integration** works with colored markers
✅ **Notes functionality** accessible from map popups
✅ **All files still under 300 lines** - compliance maintained

## Technical Details
The issue was specifically with JavaScript variable hoisting and timing. The modules were trying to share variables before they were initialized. By moving the global assignments inside the initialization functions, we ensure the variables have actual values before being shared between modules.

## Testing Confirmed
- Map loads correctly
- Excel file upload displays markers
- Marker colors reflect visit status
- Map popups show visit info and action buttons
- Drawing tools work for area selection
- All modular functionality intact
