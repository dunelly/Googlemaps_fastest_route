# Product Context: Smash Routes

## Why This Project Exists

Smash Routes was created to address the challenges faced by individuals and organizations needing to plan and optimize routes with multiple stops. Manual route planning is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, especially for logistics, real estate, and delivery professionals.

## Problems It Solves

- Reduces time spent on manual route planning.
- Minimizes travel distance and time for multi-stop journeys.
- Simplifies the process of importing, visualizing, and selecting addresses.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for both technical and non-technical users.

## How It Should Work

- Users can input addresses via manual entry, pasting, or uploading Excel/CSV files.
- The system geocodes and displays addresses on an interactive map.
- Users can select addresses for routing using map drawing tools or checkboxes.
- The application calculates the optimal route and opens it in Google Maps for navigation.

## User Experience Goals

- Fast, intuitive, and visually clear workflow.
- Minimal friction for importing and selecting addresses.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
- Immediate feedback for user actions and errors.
- Extensible for future features (user accounts, advanced routing options).
