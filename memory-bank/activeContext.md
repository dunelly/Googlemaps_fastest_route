# Active Context: Smash Routes

## Current Work Focus

- Establishing the Memory Bank documentation system for project continuity.
- Preparing to address the address selection bug in the route optimization workflow.

## Recent Changes

- Created `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` to define project requirements and context.

## Next Steps

1. Create remaining core Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
2. Diagnose and fix the bug where selecting the start/end address field deselects map-selected addresses after Excel upload.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Prioritize robust documentation to support memory resets and onboarding.
- Ensure that user selections in the UI are preserved unless explicitly changed by the user.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Documentation-first workflow.
- User-centric design for address input and selection.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The Memory Bank is essential for maintaining project continuity and effective bug fixing.
- User experience issues can arise from unintended UI state resets.
