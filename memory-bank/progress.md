# Smash Routes Project Progress Log

## 2025-06-03

### Major Features Completed
- **Modern Card-Based UI:** The main interface uses a card-based, visually unified design for address entry, file upload, and route optimization.
- **Single Entry, Paste List, and File Upload:** Users can add addresses manually, paste a list, or upload Excel/CSV files.
- **Column Mapping for Excel/CSV:** After upload, users map columns for address, name, auction date, etc.
- **Auction Date Filtering:** Users can filter addresses by auction date using a multi-select dropdown.
- **Map Integration:** Leaflet map with drawing tools for selecting addresses visually.
- **Route Optimization:** Sends addresses to backend for Google Maps route optimization and opens the result in Google Maps.
- **Copy/Mark Visited:** Users can copy selected addresses or mark them as visited.

### Google Sheets Integration
- **Paste Google Sheets URL:** Users can paste a public Google Sheets URL.
- **Backend Proxy for Google Sheets CSV:** 
  - Added `/fetch-google-sheet-csv?sheetId=...` endpoint to backend (now deployed at https://googlemaps-fastest-route-1.onrender.com).
  - Frontend now fetches Google Sheets CSV via backend proxy to avoid CORS issues.
  - Full column mapping and filtering workflow works for Google Sheets as for Excel/CSV.

### Deployment/Backend
- **Backend is deployed at:** https://googlemaps-fastest-route-1.onrender.com
- **All frontend API calls (route optimization, Google Sheets CSV) now use this backend.**

### Codebase Cleanliness
- The Google Sheets proxy code was merged into the main backend (optimize-backend.js).
- Local proxy file (google-sheets-proxy.js) can be deleted if desired.

### Outstanding/Next Steps
- [ ] Further UI polish or bugfixes as needed.
- [ ] Support for private Google Sheets (would require OAuth, not implemented).
- [ ] Any additional features or integrations as requested.

---

**Current Status:**  
The app supports manual, pasted, Excel/CSV, and Google Sheets address input, with full mapping/filtering and cloud-based backend for all major features. Ready for further testing or feature requests.
